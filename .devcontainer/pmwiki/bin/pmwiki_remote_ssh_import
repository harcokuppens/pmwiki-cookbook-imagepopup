    pmwiki_remote_ssh_import USER@REMOTEHOST:REMOTEPMWIKIDIR

DESCRIPTION

    Mirror a remote site without overwriting the new cookbook we are locally developing.
    In that way we can test our cookbook within the remote setup and data.

    The local site could have a different pmwiki install as the remote site.
    We can use this to test the remote site in a new pmwiki version.
    Only added items to an original pmwiki installation are mirrored. That is only the 
    configuration, cookbook extensions,  the wiki pages and its uploads are
    mirrored from the remote site. The means we mirror only the subfolders local/, cookbook/,
    wiki.d/, uploads/ and pub/.

    The name of the new cookbook is determined from the COOKBOOK environment variable.
    Your cookbook X can consist of directories pmwiki/cookbook/X/ and pmwiki/pub/X/. When
    the remote site is mirrored we make sure that we keep these folders of your cookbook X,
    because when mirroring from a remote side not having these folders they would get removed!
    So what you finally get is the remote cookbook/ and pub/ folder with your cookbook folders
    added.

    The argument USER@REMOTEHOST:REMOTEPMWIKIDIR is an rsync remote location using the SSH protocol
    to mirror the files.

    This script's behavior:
      - the name of your cookbook is taken from the COOKBOOK environment variable.
      - the folder /var/www/html/pmwiki is taken as the local pmwiki folder into which data gets mirrored.
      - files bigger then 0.5MB are skipped from mirroring

# mirror - https://github.com/harcokuppens/mirror
#   Mirror synchronises contents of sourcedir into destdir which can be on a remote machine,
#   a docker container, or on a docker image. Mirror wraps the rsync command to give it a
#   simpler interface to ease mirror and diffdir operations.

# when mirroring
# - only allow files smaller then 0.5 MB
# - set permissions right for our apache webserver which reads as www-data user
rsync_options='--max-size=0.5m --chmod=ugo-x,u=rw,g=rw,o=rw,Dugo+x'
# note:
#   by default the default umask can give problems:
#      $ umask -S
#      u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx
#   because rsync honors umask when creating file when mirroring, so group and other won't get the write permission I specified in rsync_options
#   we fixed it by setting the umask by default to 'u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx'
#   by adding the following line to the Dockerfile 
#       RUN echo "umask 000" >> /etc/profile
#   and in the Dockerfile we made everything withing the home directory of the www-data user `/var/www` owned and editable for this user  
#     RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
#     RUN chmod -R a+rwX /var/www
#   note: we used the homedirectory /var/www/ because when vscode logs in as the
#         www-data user in the container it then writes its remote server files within
#         the folder /var/www/.vscode-server/
#   and enabled the capability in the image to allow you to login as www-data user (which has by default as shell /usr/sbin/nologin)
#     RUN usermod -s /bin/bash www-data
